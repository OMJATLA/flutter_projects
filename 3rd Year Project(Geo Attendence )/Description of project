I spearheaded the ideation, design, and development of
the Geo Attendance System, a pioneering application
engineered using Flutter and Firebase, with GPS
integration. This solution automates attendance
tracking by harnessing geofencing technology,
revolutionizing the conventional approach. The
application empowers educators to seamlessly mark
student attendance based on proximity, ensuring
precision within a defined range between teachers and
students.
